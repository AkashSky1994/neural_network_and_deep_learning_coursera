# Neural Networks and Deep Learning by DeepLearning.ai(Coursera)

## Week 2 - Logistics Regression
Training Logistic Regression Model to detect whether the image has cat or not with acccuracy around 70percent
 
## Week 3 - Planar Data Classification Using Hidden Layer
Training the Model to detect different color lines on the graph

## Week 4 - N Layered Deep Neural Network Application (Leveraging ReLU and Sigmoid Activation Fxn)
Training the Model to detect whether the image has cat or not with a higher accuracy than the logistic regression model
